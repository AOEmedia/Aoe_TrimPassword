# Aoe_TrimPassword

## Overview

This extension trims submitted login username/password to remove leading/trailing spaces.

When sometimes user input spaces (by copy-pasting or something else) the login will fail, eventhough the username or password will look fine.
By trimming the entered values this extension makes sure that spaces/linebreaks will be ignored to support the customers experience.
